        <div class="big"><h2>Why is Credit Score Important?</h2></div>
    <p class="budget">
    Maintaining or striving for an excellent credit score, goes along with budgeting. When<br>
    seeking a new apartment, house, car, loans, etc. your credit score is used to evaluate how reliable you <br>
    are when it comes to paying bills. A credit score ranges from 300 - 850. A score of 300 is considered bad credit<br>
    and a score of 850 is considered excellent credit. There are five components that make up your credit score, which<br>
    consist of payment history, credit usage, credit history, new credit, and credit mix.

    <h3>Payment History</h3>
    <p class="budget">
    Payment history makes up 35% of your credit score and is responsible for making sure the credit card company being utilized<br>
    are aware of the time frame in which the payments are being made. It is important to pay your credit card debt and loan payments  <br>
    on time because late payments cause you credit score go down. Credit card companies will beleive that you are unreliable and <br>
    cannot make payments on time. 
    </p><br>

    <h3>Credit Usage</h3>
    <p class="budget">
        Credit Usage makes up 30% of your credit score and refers to a ratio of how much is being spent on each card<br>
        if you have more than one versus how much is available. For example, if you spent in total is $3,000 and the<br>
        avaliable credit is $9,000, your credit usage is 33%. It's best to keep your credit usage low and can keep it low <br>
        by paying monthly credit card bills fully.   
    </p><br>

    <h3>Credit History</h3>
    
    <p class="budget">
       Credit history makes up 15% of your credit score. This makes the company aware of how far back you have had <br>
       credit accounts and loans. It is better to have a longer history to show the company that you are reliable when <br>
       it comes to making payments and so that you are eligible for bigger credit avaliablity. 

    </p><br>

    <h3>New Credit </h3>
    <p class="budget">
      New Credit makes up 10% of your credit score and makes the credit card company aware of any new credit accounts <br>
       or loans that might have been opened within the same time frame. When seeing this, companies often get concerned<br>
       and worry that the customer will not be able to pay their payments on time. 

    </p><br>

    <h3>Credit Mix</h3>
    <p class="budget">
        Credit mix also makes up 10% of your credit score and lists the different types of credit you have such as credit<br>
        account, student loans, car loans, etc. Having multiple types of debt can be overwhelming for both the customer and <br>
        the credit card company, however, credit card companies like to see that you are managing multiple types of payments <br>
        which shows them that you can manage money efficiently.
