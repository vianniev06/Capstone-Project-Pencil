        <h2><center>The Basics (Budgeting)</center></h2>
        <p>
            <center>
    The basics of financial literacy begins with budgeting. Everything revolves around budgeting as it is <br>
    very useful for financial success. Starting with a budget helps manage your money efficiently and helps<br>
    plan towards a goal. First, you would consider how much you earn, and with that construct a list of expenses<br>
    and write out how much they cost. Then you would constuct another list of other expenses such as shopping and <br>
    entertainment, then strategize how much you are willing to spend, however still having money to save. After <br>
    determining how much you are spending on expenses, consider the surplus and set aside a good portion or what <br>
    ever you can to your savings. Try to keep budegting and saving a habit and keep it consistant.

        <h2><center> Saving Money </center></h2>
            <p><center>
    Another aspect of financial literacy is saving money. Saving money is important when it comes to things like emergencies<br>
    and financial goals. Saving goes along with budegeting, it is something that needs to be a habit and is something<br>
    that needs to be consistant. With consistancy comes gains and accomplishments that will lead you to your financial<br>
    dreams. When deciding how much you should start saving for a particular goal, consider time, budget, and surplus.  <br>
    While working toward a financial  or any goal, considering time is crucial, as it determines how long it takes until<br>
    it reaches success. This helps with planning even bigger goals that may come up in the future. With this, acknowledging<br>
    a budget is also pivotal because a budget plans out your spendings. When having a set plan on spendings, considering<br>
    the surplus and decide how much is needed and how much can be put away toward savings. Having a savings plan is very <br>
    important because there will be times in life where you don't know what may come next or what may come up and in those <br>
    types of situations, having money to be able to fall back on can be extremely helpful. 

        </center></p>
        
       <h2><center>Retirement Plans </center></h2>
       <p><center>
    Along with budgeting, comes financial plans. One of the most important financial plans that should be considered is your <br>
    retirement plans. Normally, this plan is associated with the benefit of most jobs, as a certain percentage of your paycheck <br>
    is required to be put away towards your retirement. In most cases, the percentage deducted from your pay check can be chosen. <br>
    In doing so, you would want to make sure that the surplus of your paycheck will suffice your expenses. If you have a job that <br>
    does not provide the opportunity to use a percentage of your paycheck to save money for retirement, then set up a savings account, <br>
    specifically for retirement and everytime you get paid, set aside a percentage of your paycheck or a set amount of money to save.<br>
    With this, ensure that the money being taken out will suffice expenses, as well keeping the payment consistant to make sure the <br>
    amount being saved grows over time.  
       </center></p>
       <h2><center>Managing Debt</center></h2>
       <p><center>
    When working toward a financial goal, such purchasing a house or car, there may be times where you may not have the kind of money <br>
    you would like and may need to take out a loan. Loans can be helpful with many things, however, can become a problem if there is no <br>
    management of the payments. Mismanagement of a loan can result is debt building upon itself, which can contribute to the decrease in <br>
    credit score. It can also take a toll on mental and emotional health as it can cause mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. <br>
    Managing money all starts with budgeting and setting a goal that consists of how much wil be contributed, by when it needs to be payed, <br>
    and how long will it takee based off of the amount being payed. With a budget, it can help with the management of debt, expenses, and other<br>
    financial plans. It is very important to make sure that before taking out a loan, a plan is already set on how the debt will be payed off <br>
    and how long it will take based off the amount being planned to pay.
