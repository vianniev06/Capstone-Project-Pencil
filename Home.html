            <h2>The Basics (Budgeting)</h2>
                <p class="budget">
            
                    The basics of financial literacy begins with budgeting. Everything revolves around budgeting as it is <br>
                    very useful for financial success. Starting with a budget can help you manage your money efficiently and helps<br>
                    plan towards reaching a goal. First, you would consider how much you earn, and with that construct a list of expenses<br>
                    and write out how much they cost. Then you would constuct another list of other expenses such as shopping and <br>
                    entertainment, then strategize how much you are willing to spend, however still having money to save. After <br>
                    determining how much you are spending on expenses, consider the surplus and set aside a good portion or what <br>
                    ever you can to your savings. Try to make budegting and saving a habit and keep it consistant.

            <h2> Saving Money </h2>
                <p class="budget">
                    Another aspect of financial literacy is saving money. Saving money is important when it comes to things like <br>
                    emergenices and financial goals. Saving goes along with budegeting; it is something that needs to be a habit <br>
                    and is something that needs to be consistant. With consistancy comes gains and accomplishments that will lead <br>
                    you to your financial dreams. When deciding how much you should start saving for a particular goal, consider time,<br>
                    budget, and surplus. While working towards a financial goal, considering time is crucial, as it determines <br>
                    how long it takes until it reaches success. This helps with planning even bigger goals that may come up in the  <br>
                    future. With this, acknowledging a budget is also pivotal because a budget plans out your spendings. When having <br>
                    a set plan on spendings, considering the surplus and deciding how much is needed and how much can be put away <br>  
                    toward savings. Having a savings plan is very important because there will be times in life where you don't know<br> 
                    what may come next or what may know what may come next or what may come up and in those types of situations, <br>
                    having money to be able to fall back on can be extremely helpful. 

                </p>
        
            <h2>Retirement Plans </h2>
                <p class="budget">
                   Along with budgeting, comes financial plans. One of the most important financial plans that should be considered <br>
                   is your retirement plans. Normally, this plan is associated with the benefit of most jobs, as a certain percentage <br>
                   of your paycheck is required to be put away towards your retirement. In most cases, the percentage deducted from <br>
                   your pay check can be chosen. In doing so, you would want to make sure that the surplus of your paycheck will suffice <br>
                   your expenses. If you have a job that does not provide the opportunity to use a percentage of your paycheck to save <br>
                   money for retirement, then set up a savings account, specifically for retirement and everytime you get paid, set aside <br> 
                   a percentage of your paycheck or a set amount of money to save. With this, emsure that the money being taken out will <br>
                   suffice expenses, as well as keeping the payment consistant to make sure the amount being saved, grows over time.

            <h2>Managing Debt</h2>
                <p class="budget">
                   When working toward a financial goal, such as purchasing a house or car, there may be times where you may not have <br>
                   the kind of money you would like and may need to take out a loan. Loans can be helpful with many things, however, <br>
                   can become a problem if there is no management of the payments. Mismanagement of a loan can result is debt building <br>
                   upon itself, which can contribute to decrease in credit score. It can also take a toll on mental and emotional health <br>
                   as it can cause mental ilnesses such as depression and anxiety. Managing money all starts with budgeting and setting a <br>
                   with the management of debt, expenses, and other financial plans. It is very important to make sure that before taking <br>
                   out a loan, a plan is already set on how the debt will be paid off and how long it will take based off the amount being <br>
                   planned to pay.
